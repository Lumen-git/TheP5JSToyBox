# The Toy Box
### Various demos I've made while learning different programming languages and concepts.

[Visit Repo](https://github.com/Lumen-git/TheToyBox/)

Very heavily based on classic math/cs demos, games, Coding Train, and other obscure projects and demos floating around online. Everything in this collection are small projects and relatively useless, but demonstrate a concept or piece of code, or are otherwise cool enough that I feel like they're worth sharing. Much like the name suggests, The Toy Box is not a serious project, but just having fun with computer science :)

Below is a quick overview of the contents of this project and its web of folders. Within each folder is a more complete list with details of each project and links to more information on certain concepts where needed.
